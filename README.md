## Spectrum Analyzer Based on FFT (MATLAB)

## Synopsis
In order to extract and examine the frequency components of time-domain signals, this project uses MATLAB to implement an FFT-based spectrum analyzer.

## Problem Description
Frequency components are not clearly visible in time-domain signals, particularly when noise is present. In this project, signals in the frequency domain are analyzed using FFT.

## Methodology: FFT-based frequency spectrum computation; signal generation and sampling; single-sided spectrum analysis; noise addition and noise floor observation; spectral leakage reduction via windowing

## Utilized Tools: MATLAB

## How to Operate
1. Launch MATLAB and open `spectrum_analyzer_project.m`.
2. Execute the script
3. Examine plots in the time and frequency domains.

## Important Takeaways: FFT and frequency resolution; noise's impact in the frequency domain; spectral leakage and windowing; and useful frequency-domain analysis
